### Environment (3)

#### Coral Reef
```
  \|/_.~._\|/_.~._\|/
  {*}={@}={*}={@}={*}
  /|\~'~'/|\~'~'/|\
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

**Why it works:** Branching coral pattern. Multiple polyp types. Repeating pattern suggests density. Diverse ecosystem.

#### School of Fish
```
  ><(°>  <°)><   ><((°>
     ><°>    <°)<  ><(°>
  <°)><  ><((°>  <°°)><

## Aesthetic Principles of the Deep Sea Theme

### 1. Bioluminescence

The deep sea is defined by glowing creatures in absolute darkness.

- **Irradiation effect:** Isolated asterisks (*) or dots appear to glow
- **Particle clouds:** Scattered * and . create an atmosphere of floating light
- **Glow organs:** Characters in braces {*} suggest enclosed light sources

### 2. Organic, Asymmetric Forms

Natural creatures aren't perfectly symmetric or geometric.

- Use non-uniform character distribution
- Avoid pure geometric shapes
- Mix rounded and angular elements
- Let patterns flow naturally

### 3. Bilateral Symmetry for Creatures

Most creatures are left-right symmetric, which aids recognition.

- Mirror patterns for main body
- Eyes placed symmetrically
- Appendages balanced
- But avoid perfect gridlines—vary slightly

### 4. Density for Mass and Shadow

Dense characters suggest bulk, shadow, and depth.

- Use # for solid bodies
- Use ¤ for dense centers
- Use ~ for water and depth
- Mix densities to show form

### 5. Spacing and Negative Space

What's not there is as important as what is.

- Use spaces for gaps, light, and open water
- Don't pack characters too tightly
- Let creatures "breathe"
- Isolation creates emphasis

### 6. Character Choice Matters

Each character carries meaning:

- `*` = glow, light, importance
- `~` = water, motion, fluidity
- `°` = eye, observation, awareness
- `@` = larger eye, power, presence
- `#` = dense mass, shadow, substance
- `/\|` = organic lines and forms
- `()[]{}` = structure, containers, vessels

### 7. Motion Lines Suggest Movement

Characters suggesting direction and flow:

- `~` = wavy motion through water
- `----->` = directional thrust
- `/\/\` = undulating tentacles
- `^~^~^` = chaotic motion

## Querying Deep Sea Creatures

```typescript
import { library } from '@veronica/ascii-art-toolkit';

// Get all bioluminescent creatures
const glowing = library.query({
  theme: 'deep-sea',
  category: 'creature',
  tags: { bioluminescence: true },
});

// Get something menacing
const scary = library.random({
  theme: 'deep-sea',
  tags: { mood: ['menacing', 'predatory'] },
});

// Get a small, delicate creature
const delicate = library.query({
  theme: 'deep-sea',
  category: 'creature',
  tags: { size: 'small', mood: ['delicate'] },
});

// All structures
const structures = library.getByCategory('deep-sea', 'structure');

// Entire ecosystem scene
const scene = library.getById('deep-sea:scene');
console.log(scene.art);
```

## Extending the Deep Sea Theme

When you want to add more pieces:

1. Commission from v0: "More deep-sea creatures in the style of [existing piece]"
2. Add to `creatures.ts` (or appropriate file)
3. Include all metadata: whyEffective, keyCharacters, techniques, tags
4. Validate with `validateLibrary()`
5. Consider zoom variants for important pieces

## Philosophy

The deep-sea theme encodes the aesthetic principle that **bioluminescence creates beauty through contrast**. Dark background, isolated points of light, organic forms, and the sense of vast emptiness create an otherworldly, slightly menacing beauty.

Each piece was designed to work standalone but also as part of larger compositions. The School of Fish and Coral Reef are designed as environments that other creatures move through. The complete Deep Sea Scene shows how multiple elements compose.
